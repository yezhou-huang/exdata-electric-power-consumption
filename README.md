exdata-electric-power-consumption
=================================
I wrote R code in plot1-4.R files respectively according to instructions in the README file at [Exploratory Data Analysis's GitHub repository for course project 1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1).

The plot1-4.png files are the respective figures. Please note I renamed the [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) data file from [the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) as *household_power_consumption.txt*, which is put in the working directory.
